# Open Source

[WBStack](https://www.wbstack.com) is run using open source code and configuration.

You can find everything in the [Github Organization](https://github.com/wbstack).

Although some of the code or configuration may currently have hard coded references to wbstack or opencura the goal would be that everything is easily reusable for other projects.
