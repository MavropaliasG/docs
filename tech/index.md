# Overview

WBStack is designed to run on Kubernetes with as little lock in to any services as possible.

The Kubernetes cluster for wbstack.com currently runs on Google Cloud, although should easily be deployable in other environments.

The only current deployment of this stack is wbstack.com

## Code

All code and configuration lives on Github in the [wbstack org](https://github.com/wbstack).

Github Actions are used in code repositories for testing and building of containers.
